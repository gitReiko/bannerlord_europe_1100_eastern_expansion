Cities placed in two files settlements.xml and scene.xscene

-------------------------

For fast update always save previous version of source files (from Europe Lemmy Map or Europe 1100).

Having the sources of the previous version we can always compare it with the current version and see the changes. This can help you solve a non-standard problem more quickly.

Remember now it is easy to save the sources, but after some time it may be very difficult or impossible to find the right version of the sources.

-------------------------

The absence of modified settlements greatly simplifies the process of updating or transferring.

-------------------------

How quick work with settlements.xml

Split the source settlements.xml file into several parts

1) modified settlement xslt file (It's better to keep all changes in one file.)
2) new settlements files (You can do a lot of them if it's convenient.)

How to update the settlements

Theoretically, you don't need to update the xml files

-------------------------

How quick work with scene.xscene

1) add new settlements to the end of the settlement block of the scene file
2) store all new settlements in a separate file from which you can quickly copy them
3) store all modified settlements in a separate file from which you can quickly copy them

How to update the settlements
1) delete all changed settlements by id from the new version of the file
2) add the modified settlements from the saved file to the end of the settlement block of the scene file
3) add the new settlements from the saved file to the end of the settlement block of the scene file
4) scene file is ready. In theory, everything should work. If something doesn't work you need to use debugging and source comparison.
