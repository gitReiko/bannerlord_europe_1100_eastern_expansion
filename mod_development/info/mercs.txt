Mercenaries

The Baltic tribes were not united. And different tribes could hire some and could not hire others. There are no written sources on this period. We can judge from neighboring states. I think aggregate Baltic tribes could hire Varangians and other tribes, for example, Lithuania, Latgalians, Yotvingians or Curonians.

The Varangians were mercenaries for all Rus Principalities

For Western South Rus (Volyn nad Halych Principalities) - Hungarians, Cumans, Berendei

For Central South Rus (Kiev, Chernigov, Pereiaslav): Cumans, Torks, Berendei
A part of Torks has settled in Rus and was vassals.
Part of the Berendians also settled and led a semi-nomadic way of life and was a vassal of Rus. According to annals unreliable, strived for independence.

For Eastern Central Rus (Suzdal-Vladimir): Berendians

For Eastern North Rus (Novgorod): river pirates Ushkuyniks

For Western North Rus (Polatsk): Lithuanians, Livonians, Latgalians
