!!! MOD IS CREATED FOR EUROPA 1100 v1.2.9.2, AND MOST LIKELY WILL NOT WORK WITH OTHER VERSIONS.

!!! Warning. Mod now requires Open Source Armory.

The mod on this page will be updated to match the Empires of Europe 1100 version on Steam. Other versions can be found on Nexus Mods https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/6277.

Update 1.4.0 Poland Duchy

- 4 new castles and 1 new city for Poland
- 1 new city for Hungary
- rework of all Poland clanes and lords
- 10 clanes and 39 historical lords for Poland

This mod has two purposes:

1. recreate Eastern Europe for mod Europa 1100
2. create transferable settlements of Eastern Europe for the Europe Lemmy Map

Eastern Europe has the same 1090-1005 timeline. Submod also tries to be as historical as possible (lack of historical and archaeological materials and my competence).

At this moment mod:

- add 15 cities, 25 castles, 54 villages
- add 10 kingdoms (Aestia, Galicia, Jatvingia, Latgalia, Lithuania, Polatsk, Prussia, Volhynia, Samogitia, Semigallia)
- add 6 cultures (Aestian, Kryvian, Jatvingian, Volhynia, Lithuanian, Latvian)
- expand 1 kingdom (Poland)

My future plans

- add Dregovian culture and further creation of Kyivan kingdom
- expand of Hungary
- planned settlements and kingdoms can be seen on the map. The map is draft and may change a lot.

Discussion, suggestions, critics

If someone can help me get a better handle on creating a character for a new culture, that would be good.

Settlements for other regions

It's possible, but at the moment I plan to focus on Eastern Europe. With a focus on the territory of Belarus, and its neighbors.

ATTENTION!!! The mod is strictly tied to the version of the main mod Empires of Europe 1100, and most likely will work only with the version for which it was created.

Compatibility with Erik's Troops

Just to place the Eastern Europe after Erik's Troops.
