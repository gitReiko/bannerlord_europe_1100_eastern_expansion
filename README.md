!!! MOD IS CREATED FOR EUROPA 1100 v1.2.10.1, AND MOST LIKELY WILL NOT WORK WITH OTHER VERSIONS.

!!! Warning. Mod now requires Open Source Armory.

The mod on this page will be updated to match the Empires of Europe 1100 version on Steam. Other versions can be found on Nexus Mods https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/6277.

Update 1.6.0 Hungary Kingdom

- compatibility 1.2.10.1
- 2 new cities, 2 new castles, 1 new village for Hungary
- 12 clanes for Hungary
- 42 lords for Hungary
- towns scenes variety (only for towns of this mod)
- 15 new javelins for Baltic factions
- start clan level is 1
- other improvements

This mod has two purposes:

1. recreate Eastern Europe for mod Europa 1100
2. create transferable settlements of Eastern Europe for the Europe Lemmy Map

Eastern Europe has the same 1090-1005 timeline. Submod also tries to be as historical as possible (lack of historical and archaeological materials and my competence).

At this moment mod:

- add 18 cities, 33 castles, 63 villages
- add 11 kingdoms (Aestia, Galicia, Jatvingia, Kyiv, Latgalia, Lithuania, Polatsk, Prussia, Volhynia, Samogitia, Semigallia)
- add 8 cultures (Aestian, Dregovian, Kryvian, Jatvingian, Volhynia, Lithuanian, Rus (reworked), Latvian)
- expand 2 kingdom (Poland, Hungary)
- 310+ lords, ladies
- 77 clans
- start clan level is 1

My future plans

- Chernigov kingdom
- Mercenary clans
- planned settlements and kingdoms can be seen on the map. The map is draft and may change a lot.

For modders

You can use any materials from my mod (settlements, banners, npc names), but do not forget to specify me as the author of the mod from which the content was taken.

Discussion, suggestions, critics

If someone can help me get a better handle on creating a character for a new culture, that would be good.

Settlements for other regions

It's possible, but at the moment I plan to focus on Eastern Europe. With a focus on the territory of Belarus, and its neighbors.

ATTENTION!!! The mod is strictly tied to the version of the main mod Empires of Europe 1100, and most likely will work only with the version for which it was created.

Compatibility with Erik's Troops

Just to place the Eastern Europe after Erik's Troops.
