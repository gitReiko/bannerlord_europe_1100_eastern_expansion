!!! MOD IS CREATED FOR EUROPA 1100 v1.2.8.3, AND MOST LIKELY WILL NOT WORK WITH OTHER VERSIONS.

The mod on this page will be updated to match the Europe 1100 version on Steam. Other versions can be found on Nexus Mods https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/6277.

This mod has two purposes:

1. recreate Eastern Europe for mod Europa 1100
2. create 'easily' transferable settlements of Eastern Europe for the Europe Lemmy Map

The action of the expansion takes place in the same timeline of 1090-1005. Submod also tries to be as historical as possible (lack of historical and archaeological materials) and my competence permits.

What does the mod add at this point:

- many settlements
- one new kingdom and culture (Polatsk Principality)
- greatly expands and improves the kingdom of the Baltic Tribes

My future plans

- take a rest
- update my translations
- start work on the next update (Volhynia Principality)
- planned settlements and kingdoms can be seen on the map. The map is draft and may change a lot. I don't know anything about Estonia, but I understand that I can make a compact kingdom. For that I will need help.

If someone can help me get a better handle on creating a character for a new culture, that would be good.

Settlements for other regions

It's possible, but at the moment I plan to focus on Eastern Europe. With a focus on the territory of Belarus, and its neighbors.

ATTENTION!!! The mod is strictly tied to the version of the main mod Europe 1100, and most likely will work only with the version for which it was created.
