   <Hero id="lord_polotsk_1a" faction="Faction.clan_rus_9" text="{=lord_polotsk_1a.text}During the reign of Usiasłaŭ II the Seer Polatsk Principality reached its greatest dawn. The ruler subjugated all the tribes along the river Western Dvina (Daugava). Latgalians, Selonians and Livonians paid tribute and participated in military campaigns. Was able to defend Polotsk from Rus. Despite numerous wars Rus could not conquer Polotsk or part of its territory. The prince became a Seer (Čarodiej) in Old Rus and Belarusian folklore. According to legend, he was born as a result of a magic ritual and could turn into a wolf and other animals to quickly run around his lands." />
