  <string id="str_culture_description.latvian" text="{=latviandescription}The generalized culture of the Baltic tribes that lived on the territory of modern Latvia: Curonians, Zemgalians (Semigallians), Selonians and Latgalians. The Curonians belong to the Western Balts, the other tribes to the Eastern Balts. By 1100 these tribes had formed many small principalities, which often formed alliances against strong enemies, for example in 1106 the Zemgalians defeated a large Polatsk army and stop Polatsk's expansion into the region for a long time. In 1202 the Livonian Brothers of the Sword was founded order in Riga, which in 1237 became part of the Teutonic Order. This state conquered and Christianized the Latvian Baltic tribes and Finnish tribe of Livonians. Teutonic state existed on the land of Latvia until 1561, later this state was divided into several vassal duchies, which existed almost until the beginning of the 19th century. During this time, the Latvian nation was formed from Baltic tribes, which now has an independent state." />
