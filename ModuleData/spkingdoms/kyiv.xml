			 text="{=kyiv_kingdom_text}The idea that Rus was a monolithic state with a single ethnos, formed by the later Empires, which wanted to create an illusion of unity of its population. In reality, Rus has never controlled the territory drawn on the maps. The territory was home to many ethnic groups and principalities that fought, traded, and befriended each other. The main unifying factor was Christianity, but it was practiced by a minority who were the elite. The main population was pagan. Over time, the elite spread the culture to the general population, but this happened many centuries after the collapse of Rus. In 1097 to stop the endless wars was organized Liubech Congress, at which the separate branches of the once united dynasty divided the power. Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych fixed for himself the following possessions: Kyiv, Turau-Pinsk, Novgorod lands and Pogoryno. Legally these lands became part of the Kyivan Principality. But Novgorodians did not recognize the power of Sviatopolk and in fact Novgorod withdrew to Volodymyr Monomakh. This created tension between the princes and almost didn't lead to war. Tensions continued until Sviatopolk's death. Probably Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych was the instigator of the conflict that resulted in Vasylko Rostyslavych being blinded. In 1100, the Principality of Kyiv had the formal status of the main Rus Principality. In fact, it was the capital of Rus, but it could not govern most of the territories because they belonged to other principalities.">
