		   text="{=polatsk_kingdom_text}The first mention of Polatsk (Palteskja) is recorded in the semi-legendary Þiðreks saga af Bern (Thidrekssaga, Wilkinasaga). Around 447 Atilla captured and pillaged it. In the saga, the city is presented as a wealthy well-protected regional center. Quite often Polatsk is represented as part of the Rus state, despite the fact that in the chronicles Polatsk is constantly at war with Rus until its collapse. By 1100 Polatsk had captured from Rus the major regional centers of Minsk and Vitebsk. For more than 500 years history of existence of Polatsk Principality Rus princes ruled in Polatsk only 26 years. During the reign of the Usiasłaŭ II the Seer, the Polatsk Principality reached its greatest prosperity. In the second half of the 13th century, the principality became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an autonomous part. A few centuries later, when the term Ruthenian became equal to Orthodox, Polatsk became Ruthenian.">
