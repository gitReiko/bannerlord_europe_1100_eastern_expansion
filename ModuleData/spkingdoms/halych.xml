		   text="{=halych_kingdom_text}The idea that Rus was a monolithic state with a single ethnos, formed by the later Empires, which wanted to create an illusion of unity of its population. In reality, Rus has never controlled the territory drawn on the maps. The territory was home to many ethnic groups and principalities that fought, traded, and befriended each other. The main unifying factor was Christianity, but it was practiced by a minority who were the elite. The main population was pagan. Over time, the elite spread the culture to the general population, but this happened many centuries after the collapse of Rus. The elite of the White Croatian ethnos retained the memory of their independent principalities. In 1084 with the help of Rurik Rostyslavich and his brothers successfully founded independent Croatian princedoms which acted in union and could defend the independence from Rus. In 1097 at the Liubech Congress independence was legally confirmed. By 1144 the principalities were united into the Principality of Halych.">
