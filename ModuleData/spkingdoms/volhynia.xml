		   text="{=volhynia_kingdom_text}Rus as a single state never existed. Rus rather was a proto-empire, which tried to subjugate a large number of principalities with different ethnicities. Other princes were formally subordinate to the Grand Knyaz, but his power usually ended with the collection of tribute. From the foundation of Rus to its collapse there were endless wars between princes. In 1097 to stop the endless wars was organized Liubech Congress, at which the separate branches of the once united dynasty divided the power. Possession of the Volhynian Principality was given to Davyd Igorovich. In the same year 1097, with the support of the Kyivan Grand Knyaz, Davyd Igorovich started a war with the Terebovlian prince, whom he blinded. Toward the end of his life, as a result of diplomatic and military games, Davyd Igorovich lost the title of Volhynian Prince, but had extensive holdings.">
