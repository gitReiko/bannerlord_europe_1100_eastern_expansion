		   text="{=hungarian_kingdom_text}Around the year 1100, the Kingdom of Hungary was undergoing a transformative period in its history. At that time, Hungary was ruled by King Coloman, also known as Coloman the Learned or Coloman the Bookish. Coloman's reign marked a period of expansion and consolidation of royal power. He pursued an ambitious territorial agenda, incorporating territories such as Croatia, Dalmatia, and parts of present-day Slovakia into the kingdom. Coloman's rule was characterized by efforts to centralize authority and promote cultural and legal reforms. He aimed to strengthen the position of the crown and establish a more unified and organized kingdom. Coloman's policies were influenced by his commitment to Christianity, and he actively supported the Catholic Church's influence in the region. This period set the stage for Hungary's further development as a significant power in Central Europe.">
