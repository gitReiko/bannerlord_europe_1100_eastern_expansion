  <string id="aestia_kingdom_text" text="Estonia in the 1100-1200 AD was characterized by a decentralized political landscape. The Estonian people, primarily of Finno-Ugric descent, inhabited a land of dense forests, fertile plains, and a coastline dotted with small ports. The society was organized into various tribes or clans, each led by chieftains or elders. These tribes engaged in agriculture, fishing, and trading activities, forming the backbone of the economy. The Estonians were skilled craftsmen, known for their expertise in metalwork, woodworking, and textile production. Despite their decentralized structure, the Estonian tribes often united under a common cause to defend against external threats. They faced frequent raids from neighboring powers, such as the Swedes, Danes, Russians and Germans, who sought to expand their influence into the Baltic region. By the late 12th century, the influence of Christianity began to permeate Estonia through trade and missionary activities. However, the conversion process was gradual and met with resistance from some pagan factions. Overall, Estonia in the 1100-1200 AD was a land of diverse cultures, where tribal identities intersected with emerging political dynamics, shaping the course of its history."/>

In reality, Rus has never controlled the territory drawn on the maps. The territory was home to many ethnic groups and principalities that fought, traded, and befriended each other. The main unifying factor was Christianity, but it was practiced by a minority who were the elite. The main population was pagan. Over time, the elite spread the culture to the general population, but this happened many centuries after the collapse of Rus. The elite of the White Croatian ethnos retained the memory of their independent principalities. In 1084 with the help of Rurik Rostyslavich and his brothers successfully founded independent Croatian princedoms which acted in union and could defend the independence from Rus. In 1097 at the Liubech Congress independence was legally confirmed. By 1144 the principalities were united into the Principality of Halych."/>

Brest became the frontier fortress of Rus. Further attempts Rus to subdue the Jatvingian lands were unsuccessful. In 1100 Navahrudak, Hrodna, Vaŭkavysk and other princedoms probably existed on the Belarusian lands. Due to lack of written sources it is difficult to tell exact names and borders of princedoms. Outside of Belarus existed the principalities of Dainava and Sūduva. After a successful invasion in 1258, Ruthenian king of Danylo Romanovych succeeded in capturing the Vaŭkavysk princedom, for a short time. The further destiny of the Jatvingian principalities is connected with joining to the Lithuanian Principality for resistance to common enemies: Golden Horde, Ruthenian Kingdom and Teutonic Order."/>

But Novgorodians did not recognize the power of Sviatopolk and in fact Novgorod withdrew to Volodymyr Monomakh. This created tension between the princes and almost didn't lead to war. Tensions continued until Sviatopolk's death. Probably Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych was the instigator of the conflict that resulted in Vasylko Rostyslavych being blinded. In 1100, the Principality of Kyiv had the formal status of the main Rus Principality. In fact, it was the capital of Rus, but it could not govern most of the territories because they belonged to other principalities."/>

In 1100 the principalities close to Polatsk were probably vassals (Nalša and Alša). Other principalities were independent but not united, they traded, fought with each other and against common enemies (Deltuva, Lietuva and Neris). To the first half of the 12th century Lithuania took the leading role, and the Polatsk through dynastic alliances became part of Lithuania."/>

Władysław I sought to consolidate and expand his authority, focusing on strengthening the central power of the Grand Duchy. His reign saw an increased integration of various Polish regions and the establishment of a more cohesive political structure. Additionally, Władysław I faced challenges from neighboring powers, including the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus, which influenced the geopolitical dynamics of the region.

Quite often Polatsk is represented as part of the Rus state, despite the fact that in the chronicles Polatsk is constantly at war with Rus until its collapse. By 1100 Polatsk had captured from Rus the major regional centers of Minsk and Vitebsk. For more than 500 years history of existence of Polatsk Principality Rus princes ruled in Polatsk only 26 years. During the reign of the Usiasłaŭ II the Seer, the Polatsk Principality reached its greatest prosperity.
