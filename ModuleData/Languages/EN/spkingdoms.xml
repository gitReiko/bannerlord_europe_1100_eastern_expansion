  <string id="baltic_tribes_text" text="In the 12th and 13th centuries, internal struggles and invasions by Ruthenians and Poles, and later the expansion of the Teutonic Order, resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians. Gradually, Old Prussians became Germanized or Lithuanized between the 15th and 17th centuries, especially after the Reformation in Prussia. The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern-day countries of Latvia and Lithuania."/>

The first reliable written sources about these settlements date back to the 13th century. Sources speak about an attempt of the Volhynia Principality to conquer the region.{newline}The chronicle Principality of Grodno was probably located in the modern Davyd-Haradok, which was built by Davyd Igorovich in 1100. Later, his son Vsevolodko became the first knyaz of Haradok.{newline}For a long time Rus tried to force the Jatvingians to pay tribute. The territory around modern Brest was conquered by Rus before the 12th century. In the 13th century Mazovia, Volhynia and Cumans made a joint campaign against the Jatvingians. It's an indicator of Jatvingians power.{newline}The expansion of the Teutonic Order and Volhynia in the 13th century pushed the locals to ally with Lithuania."/>

  <string id="volhynia_kingdom_text" text="Rus as a single state never existed. Rus rather was a proto-empire, which tried to subjugate a large number of principalities with different ethnicities. Other princes were formally subordinate to the Grand Knyaz, but his power usually ended with the collection of tribute. From the foundation of Rus to its collapse there were endless wars between princes. In 1097 to stop the endless wars was organized Liubech Congress, at which the separate branches of the once united dynasty divided the power. Possession of the Volhynian Principality was legally given to Davyd Igorovich. In the same year 1097, with the support of the Kyivan Grand Knyaz, Davyd Igorovich started a war with the Terebovlian prince, whom he blinded. Toward the end of his life, as a result of diplomatic and military games, Davyd Igorovich lost the title of Volhynian Prince, but had extensive holdings."/>
