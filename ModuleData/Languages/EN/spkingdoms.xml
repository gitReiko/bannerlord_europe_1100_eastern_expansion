Gradually, Old Prussians became Germanized or Lithuanized between the 15th and 17th centuries, especially after the Reformation in Prussia. The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern-day countries of Latvia and Lithuania."/>

In reality, Rus has never controlled the territory drawn on the maps. The territory was home to many ethnic groups and principalities that fought, traded, and befriended each other. The main unifying factor was Christianity, but it was practiced by a minority who were the elite. The main population was pagan. Over time, the elite spread the culture to the general population, but this happened many centuries after the collapse of Rus. The elite of the White Croatian ethnos retained the memory of their independent principalities. In 1084 with the help of Rurik Rostyslavich and his brothers successfully founded independent Croatian princedoms which acted in union and could defend the independence from Rus. In 1097 at the Liubech Congress independence was legally confirmed. By 1144 the principalities were united into the Principality of Halych."/>

Later, his son Vsevolodko became the first knyaz of Haradok.{newline}For a long time Rus tried to force the Jatvingians to pay tribute. The territory around modern Brest was conquered by Rus before the 12th century. In the 13th century Mazovia, Volhynia and Cumans made a joint campaign against the Jatvingians. It's an indicator of Jatvingians power.{newline}The expansion of the Teutonic Order and Volhynia in the 13th century pushed the locals to ally with Lithuania."/>

By 1100 Polatsk had captured from Rus the major regional centers of Minsk and Vitebsk. For more than 500 years history of existence of Polatsk Principality Rus princes ruled in Polatsk only 26 years. During the reign of the Usiasłaŭ II the Seer, the Polatsk Principality reached its greatest prosperity. In the second half of the 13th century, the principality became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as an autonomous part.
