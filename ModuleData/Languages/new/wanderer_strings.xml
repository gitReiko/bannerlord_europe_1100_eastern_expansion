  <string id="xSbEUPK4" text="You know, we women suffer greatly when you warriors have your sport..."/>
  <string id="ifBURmmv" text="I lived in a village to the north of here, across the gulf. It is a cruel land; there is no strong king, and lords think nothing of ravaging their neighbor's lands. My mother was skilled in the use of herbs to treat disease and wounds. I had a happy peaceful childhood - until one day, a month before I was to be married."/>
  <string id="WBE6MeCl" text="That was the day my life changed. A band from a nearby village came and attacked us. We had done them no harm; we had never even thought of them as our enemies. But they wanted our cattle. They killed my mother and the youth who I was to marry, and burned our village. Everything gone. Those who lived fled into the woods."/>
  <string id="hOsJjMZ8" text="I expect that my kin will soon return to their homes, but I will not.  I cannot... I cannot be in a place where I am at the mercy of any beast on the rampage. I will ply my trade among warriors. I will learn to harm as well as to heal. And if the time comes for me to marry, I will live in a land where there is a king, even a tyrant, rather than raising a family amid the war of all against all."/>
  <string id="31XTldnZ" text="I am sorry for your fate, my lady."/>
  <string id="l4A16aGs" text="It's a cruel world, and if you think a warrior's life is any easier, you have a painful lesson in store."/>
  <string id="iYbBHXNA" text="At any rate, if you know of a warband who is looking for someone who knows how to treat wounds, I would be grateful."/>
  <string id="N0yE1Ptz" text="I was an herbalist in a village in the north. But our home was raided, and I've been forced to wander in search of work. There are many like me on the roads of Calradia."/>
  <string id="BuamWVTp" text="Yes.. My story... Jealousy, envy of my talents. That's always been my undoing."/>
  <string id="L14od7cC" text="When I was a boy, I was the best fighter in my village. 'You're stronger as a boy than a full-grown warrior,' people would say. I'm not boasting here - that's what they'd tell me. So when I came of age I went off to make my fortune."/>
  <string id="zb6VN6rr" text="Started in the Vaegir guard. I found that I was the only real warrior among them. They were all about marching here and there in their pretty uniforms, not pulling sword from scabbard for months on end. I told them what I thought, and my captain told me to keep my mouth shut or leave. So I left."/>
  <string id="iAmsyL01" text="Then I joined the Skolderbroda. The 'Shield Brothers.' It's a good name, you know? They spent most of their time hunkering behind their shields. Ha! Me, I'd wade into the midst of the enemy, dealing out death right and left - and, well, all they had to say afterward was 'Why didn't you keep ranks?'"/>
  <string id="4ee0aofe" text="Hmm... Strange response."/>
  <string id="FNuxKNBi" text="Has no one told you that leaving a gap in a shield wall is as good as treason?"/>
  <string id="qbYupvSJ" text="So I'm having no more of that. I'm on the look-out for an outfit that employs real fighters."/>
  <string id="gnLnZuAH" text="Let me tell you friend, I'm hard. I've fought with the Skolderbroda, the Vaegirs, any mercenaries worth their salt, I've been with them. Others may tell you've they've done what I've done, but I'm the real thing."/>
  <string id="RObjObjy" text="Certainly - I make no secret of my ambitions."/>
  <string id="NKLS5mN1" text="My father was one of the leading warriors of our clan, but in his last battle his hamstring was cut. We've lived well off the wealth he brought home from his raids, buying land and thralls, but now I feel it's time that I bring home some silver of my own."/>
  <string id="jaLrENzo" text="I need to buy a ship, and hire men to row it. But I do not wish to sell our land to outfit a risky voyage, to risk depriving my father and mother of their comforts in old age, and my brothers of their hopes for a good marriage."/>
  <string id="TxwPTwvh" text="So I have resolved to hire out my sword and make enough money for such a ship. Having done so, I shall take it to faraway shores and bring home silver and slaves so that we may buy land enough for all. In this way I will do my duty to my family."/>
  <string id="3QxjeC94" text="You are a most dutiful son and brother."/>
  <string id="nqLiWPR7" text="Such pieties from a man who intends to pillage the labor of others."/>
  <string id="3W1H83WZ" text="At any rate, if you know the leader of warband who's generous and honorable, he'll find no braver warrior to follow him than me."/>
  <string id="QJCieDQ9" text="My father sent me off into the world, to build our fortune with my sword. This is a common story among the sons of our people."/>
  <string id="gysOh3M5" text="Aye - you've heard about the death of the last Emperor?"/>
  <string id="DFW5i63X" text="I'll tell you - what most people believe is a pack of lies. I was in the Vaegir guard in the time of Arenicos. We took our discipline seriously; we were proud of it. Then the riots happened. What I saw in {IMPERIALCAPITAL}.. Even now it makes me feel ashamed."/>
  <string id="mGTuBDtF" text="It wasn't easy for the men. They felt the city turn against them, blame them for killing the emperor. Whereas we were sure that we were innocent of his blood, that there was some sort of trick. But even so, there was no excuse."/>
  <string id="SwwXXPNe" text="We could have marched out in battle array. No one would have stood against us. If we couldn't restore order, at least we could have gone home with honor. But instead, we turned our anger against the city. My comrades looted, set fires, even murdered those who we were supposed to protect. It was a disgrace."/>
  <string id="HiJTqUPJ" text="I have heard about the riots in {IMPERIALCAPITAL}. It was an ugly thing all round."/>
  <string id="JHduQdEb" text="The Guard didn't kill the Emperor? Funny, that's not what the witnesses said."/>
  <string id="ZoxPPYLX" text="I thought of going home. But I lost what denars I had saved during the riots. If there is a warband looking for good men, I would like to earn it back."/>
  <string id="7tCl75xJ" text="I was part of the old Emperor Arenicos's Vaegir Guard. But the people turned on us after his death, and attacked us. Maybe you've heard the story before. There's a whole lot of us, spat out into the world by the ungrateful Calradians."/>
  <string id="1Slubhxc" text="It's not many who ask that question."/>
  <string id="Csokpo5C" text="I was a farmer. But I split a man's head open with a hoe. He was also a farmer. It was a dispute over a broken fence, between my pasture and his. I had no intention of killing him."/>
  <string id="JLHhV1ta" text="His cousins came for me, to take me to judgment. I would have gone willingly; I would have paid blood-money. Gladly. But one of them laid hands on me, and a black rage came over me, and I killed two of them, too. I didn't want to kill them either. "/>
  <string id="W2Jhsc2X" text="That was that. I could pay blood money for one man but not three. I fled. I cannot return."/>
  <string id="zX3hVUKI" text="It sounds like you had no choice."/>
  <string id="K9ig7Mst" text="A man who cannot master his rage is a greater threat then the man who murders with intent."/>
  <string id="1gXv1YlG" text="If the choice I had been mine, I would have never hurt anyone. I would live on my land, eat what I had grown, marry and have children. But the Heavens have decreed that I should eat by shedding other men's blood. In the city, rich men pay me well for that."/>
  <string id="b1Ucozvw" text="I was a farmer once. I killed a man in a fight and could not pay the blood money, so I had to flee. It's a common enough tale in the northlands. I accept that my destiny will be blood and hardship, rather than the simple life on the land I once craved."/>
  <string id="E7z7aoQo" text="Look, friend, I'm here to drink, not talk. But if you really want to know, I'll give it to you in brief."/>
  <string id="Zu4uBSxk" text="We Sturgians have a tradition. If two people have a dispute, and there's no witnesses, so it all comes down to one man's word against another's, then we let them settle it with swords. If one man doesn't like to fight, he can hire someone else to do the fighting. That's how it works with us. Probably other people do the same, because it's a good tradition."/>
  <string id="r8ga8i93" text="I like to fight, so I made it known that I'd fight for anyone if the price is right. Shed a little blood, make a little coin, drink it away, make a little more, all in the cause of justice. Not a bad life, eh?"/>
  <string id="ExBNUPTm" text="Well, I guess I showed myself a bit too eager. The councils stopped accepting me as champion. Told me I sold my sword too cheaply, they said. What can I say? I have to look for other work now. It's a damn shame. I like duels - you don't worry about arrows, or someone coming up from behind. No need to stay sober for hours on end waiting for a fight that never comes. Just a few minutes of trouble, a bit of blood, and then usually a good meal afterwards."/>
  <string id="AlZlPv4b" text="Councils these days. Always making changes..."/>
  <string id="Fgsd3jBn" text="You call that the cause of justice?"/>
  <string id="2UEpvIIV" text=" But look - I'd still be a fine addition to a fighting company. I know how to swing a sword and an axe, and know a thing or two about forging them and keeping them sharp as well."/>
  <string id="IVIIkCaY" text="I was a sword for hire. Specialized in duels - you know, when there's a trial, and you can't work it out any other way. But you can run that racket too long - eventually the councils start banning you from fighting - so now here I am."/>
  <string id="x9l3KCvQ" text="I'll tell you, but I don't know why you'd be interested."/>
  <string id="OuUzIkaK" text="My parents died when I was young. My sister married. Her husband wanted my parents' farm. So he hired a devious man, a fast-talker, who knew the law well. He said... I don't even remember what he said, in court, before the council. But the council awarded both of them the farm."/>
  <string id="9bezXRLp" text="It did not matter much. I always preferred the woods. I made a better living shooting squirrels and rabbits and selling fur. "/>
  <string id="gqWMrx3S" text="But I've been thinking.. Maybe I want to marry. And I guess I need more silver for that, probably more than I can get from the squirrels. So... People tell me that warleaders will pay for a good scout. And I know the woods well."/>
  <string id="Vs428XEb" text="That seems a reasonable ambition. A good scout can command a high price."/>
  <string id="FMnIiXge" text="What woman wouldn't relish a husband smelling of half-cured skins, slept in for the whole winter?"/>
  <string id="gSXfbTn5" text="I know the woods well. I can move quickly in them. I'll tell you all about a war party from the branches it broke marching through."/>
  <string id="UydGgLl9" text="I'm a trapper, a hunter. Used to be I could make a good living through furs... But with all these bandits about.... I'd rather be part of an army, I think. Spent my whole life in the woods and I reckon I could do well as a scout."/>
  <string id="2rX8VwCj" text="I'll tell you my story. Why not?"/>
  <string id="7qlJdbtC" text="My father was a draftsman. He helped build towers and walls for the boyars. I used to help him in his work, drawing up his plans. I had a good hand for that. We went from town to town, employer to employer, just the two of us. It was a wonderful time, until he dropped dead, just before I entered my twelfth year."/>
  <string id="z2Vv7D3b" text="My mother had already died, so I was taken in by my uncle. But he didn't really want me. See, I had a birthmark on my shoulder, the kind that some people means the bearer can cast the Evil Eye. Whenever there was sickness in the streets of my uncles' village, the people would mutter and curse at me. Eventually they demanded my uncle drive me out of the village. It was no great loss for him to comply. Probably saved him worry over where he was going to find the money to marry me off."/>
  <string id="gLaZnLBe" text="I wandered from village to village, begging and stealing. You may imagine how I fared at the mercy of the robbers of the road, who had no more fear of sorcery then they did of man's laws. But eventually I learned to protect myself, and the body of one careless bandit afforded me with my first sword and leather jerkin."/>
  <string id="BVQ075W6" text="A sad tale. Please continue."/>
  <string id="aIPLCDp7" text="Heavens protect us from evil! Away! Away!"/>
  <string id="CEb36UEm" text="That is all there is to say, really. I still have the sword, and it is for hire, to those who pay well. I still remember a bit of my father's trade, too. I'll do most whatever is needed. The world had no mercy on me, so I feel no need to show any."/>
  <string id="bNUxoLhP" text="I don't know where I came from. First thing I remember is wandering the roads with a bunch of other orphans, going from village to village begging and stealing. But now, you see, I've stolen a sword from a group of bandits we found sleeping off a drunken night, and I figure maybe I can be something different."/>
  <string id="rKeqsRyj" text="I'll tell you my tale. But I will warn you in advance: It is of no concern to me whether you approve or disapprove of what I did."/>
  <string id="o6ugLOZi" text="I came from a good family, with much land. Since I was a girl, I wished to be a shield-maiden. I practiced fighting with the village boys and the old warriors. But it is a strange thing - while some families in our lands take pride in a daughter who takes up arms, others accord it a great shame, and my father was of the latter type."/>
  <string id="R2haBQK7" text="I had no special desire to be married but my family found me a groom anyway. I consented, but my husband and I detested each other from the first. Once he insulted me in the marketplace, I cursed his manhood, he struck me, and I pulled a knife and he pulled his. I won."/>
  <string id="SfmWAuv3" text="The elders sat in judgment on our case. As it turned out, they had plenty of precedent. They accorded our fight a fair duel, and thus I was innocent of murder. On the other hand, I was excluded from his inheritance. I suppose that was fair, although I would have enjoyed wearing his jewels and riding his horse in front of his family."/>
  <string id="DhQ7lgNr" text="Indeed. No doubt such traditions encourages husbands to behave better than they might do otherwise."/>
  <string id="tbbQ3PZH" text="You slew your husband in a duel? Get away!"/>
  <string id="5mUCH99p" text="Suffice to say, I could not return to my father's house. I went on my way, happy to live the life of a warrior I had always dreamed of living. But soon I found out - the tales I loved as a girl, of shield-maidens who fought for honor, do not pertain to a woman with no family or land. One cannot fight for honor when one doesn't know where the next meal comes from. So I fight for pay."/>
  <string id="UCpJEIE3" text="I am a warrior. A shield-maiden, as the Nords say. It is not uncommon in the northern lands. Perhaps you have met some of us before."/>
  <string id="Wzl0V95v" text="Pour yourself a drink stranger. I'll tell you all you need to know."/>
  <string id="agmuAXJc" text="How would I put it? I guess I'd say I'm a lady who's gotten a reputation for doing a man's work better then the men. I guess I'm a bit of a rarity. Although that's a bit of a surprise to me."/>
  <string id="ELLbiNDu" text="You won't find me passed out in the straw in my own vomit when needed for a task. You won't have to bribe the guard to get me out of a cell because I got on a fight on my way to work."/>
  <string id="F81bgvec" text="Instead, for my fee, I'll make sure that those who need protecting are protected, and those who need to die are dead."/>
  <string id="TwbAHDDJ" text="Yes... So hard to find a dependable fighter these days."/>
  <string id="4rC9tzki" text="I don't begrudge a warrior a few drinks and a fight from time to time."/>
  <string id="wxSiMjJ0" text="Anyway, you come across a chief who needs a reliable sword in his warband, you let me know."/>
  <string id="kQO0wZLj" text="I guess I'd say that I'm just a lady who didn't care for her distaff, and took up a spear instead. If you want to know more, hire me, point me at your enemies, and I'll show you rather than tell you."/>
